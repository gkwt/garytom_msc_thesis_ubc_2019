\chapter{Preface}

Analysis code using the normalisation scheme of $dI/dV$ described in \autoref{ch:exptech} were included in a publication in American Chemical Society's Journal of Physical Chemistry C journal (\citealt{cochrane2018molecularly}).

Experiments outlined in \autoref{ch:opv} and \autoref{ch:oled} were performed by myself with help from Giang Nguyen and Erik M\aa rsell. I analysed all data with custom MATLAB scripts, and also performed the density functional theory calculations. Work done in these chapters is unpublished.
